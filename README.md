# WWCodeHackathon
Women Who Code for Social Good Hackathon Project focusing on financial inclusion and behavioral metrics 




Timeline
Oct 12 - Opening
  - have a list of variables to regress against payability (pred. lending, payday loan, low credit risk) -> have a clear hypothesis

Oct 14-15
  - do expoloratory analysis on our own

Oct 16-20 (work week)
  - block hours 9am-12pm (CST) / 7am-10am (PST)
  - work on code, final product, demo

Oct 21: finalize end product
Oct 22: deadline

To do:
  - decide on end product: visualization of the regression, data exploratory maps (interactive web app from R, i.e. Shiny App)
  - demo/walkthrough
  - data exploration: different maps and graphs showing the 
  - picking variables regarding payability
  - run regressions for each personas


a - likely rejected
b - complete opposite of a
c - basically the same, good candidate, 1 factor cannot control (race, etc.)  -> get access or no access
d - fall short -> give benefit of the doubt 

regression: worst
