# WWCodeHackathon
Women Who Code for Social Good Hackathon Project focusing on financial inclusion and behavioral metrics 

Timeline
Oct 12 - Opening
  - have a list of variables to regress against payability (pred. lending, payday loan, low credit risk) -> have a clear hypothesis

Oct 14-15
  - do expoloratory analysis on our own

Oct 16-20 (work week)
  - block hours 9am-12pm (CST) / 7am-10am (PST)
  - work on code, final product, demo

Oct 21: finalize end product
Oct 22: deadline

To do:
  - decide on end product: visualization of the regression, data exploratory maps and graphs that proves our hypothesis (interactive web app from R, i.e. Shiny App)
  - 
  - demo/walkthrough
  - data exploration: different maps and graphs showing the 
  - picking variables regarding payability
  - run regressions for each personas

Personas:
  A: likely rejected
  B: complete opposite of A
  C: basically the same, good candidate, 1 factor cannot control (race, etc.)  -> get access or no access
  D: fall short -> give benefit of the doubt 

Hypothesis:
1) worst persona better off by looking at the financial history using our regression -> we prove our model is better than the credit evaluation traditional model.
2) millions of america are subjected to snap shot of behaviors for lending decision. We believe that looking at one's financial history and behaviors over time is a better indicator and a more comprehensive evaluation of lendabiliy
